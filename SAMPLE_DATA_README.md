## Testing the Analytics Dashboard

### View Analytics for Each Event
- Event 1: http://localhost:5173/events/1/analytics
- Event 2: http://localhost:5173/events/2/analytics
- Event 3: http://localhost:5173/events/3/analytics
- Event 4: http://localhost:5173/events/4/analytics
- Event 5: http://localhost:5173/events/5/analytics

### API Endpoints
- List all events: http://localhost:8000/api/events/
- Event 1 details: http://localhost:8000/api/events/1/
- Event 1 analytics: http://localhost:8000/api/events/1/analytics/

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High Attendance (Event 1 - Spring Concert)
- 80% check-in rate
- 75% capacity utilization
- Good turnout, room for more tickets

### Scenario 2: Full House (Event 4 - Basketball Tournament)
- 100% check-in rate
- 66.7% capacity utilization
- All tickets used, still has venue capacity

### Scenario 3: Lower Attendance (Event 5 - Networking Night)
- 56.25% check-in rate
- 53.3% capacity utilization
- Many no-shows, plenty of space

### Scenario 4: Near Capacity (Event 3 - Tech Conference)
- 72% check-in rate
- 83.3% capacity utilization
- Getting full, limited tickets available

## Cleaning Up

To remove all sample data:

```bash
cd backend/collegeEventsWeb
python manage.py flush
```

Then recreate with:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py create_sample_data
```

## Notes

- All events are set to occur in the future (3-45 days from now)
- Tickets are distributed among the 5 test attendees
- Check-in status varies to demonstrate different analytics scenarios
- All passwords are set to `testpass123` for easy testing
