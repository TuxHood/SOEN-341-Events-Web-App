- [x] Backend analytics endpoint created
- [x] Frontend dashboard component created
- [x] API service layer implemented
- [x] Documentation written
- [x] Visual mockups prepared

---

## üìã Backend Setup

### Step 1: Verify Models
- [ ] Check that `Event` model has `venue` ForeignKey
- [ ] Check that `Venue` model has `capacity` field
- [ ] Check that `Ticket` model has `is_used` field
- [ ] Check that `Ticket` model has `event` ForeignKey

### Step 2: Verify API Endpoint
- [ ] Start backend server: `./scripts/start-backend.cmd`
- [ ] Test endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/events/1/analytics/`
- [ ] Verify response contains all expected fields:
  - [ ] event_id
  - [ ] event_title
  - [ ] tickets_issued
  - [ ] tickets_checked_in
  - [ ] tickets_pending
  - [ ] venue_capacity
  - [ ] remaining_capacity
  - [ ] check_in_percentage
  - [ ] capacity_utilization

### Step 3: Create Test Data (Optional but Recommended)
```python
# Run in Django shell: python manage.py shell
from event_management.models import Event, Venue
from ticket_services.models import Ticket
from user_accounts.models import User

# Create venue
venue = Venue.objects.create(
    name="Main Auditorium",
    address="123 Campus Drive",
    capacity=200
)

# Create event
organizer = User.objects.first()  # or create a new user
event = Event.objects.create(
    title="Analytics Test Event",
    description="Event for testing analytics",
    venue=venue,
    organizer=organizer,
    start_time="2025-11-01 18:00:00",
    end_time="2025-11-01 22:00:00",
    is_published=True
)

# Create 150 tickets
user = User.objects.first()
for i in range(150):
    Ticket.objects.create(event=event, owner=user)

# Mark 120 as checked in
Ticket.objects.filter(event=event)[:120].update(is_used=True)

print(f"Created event ID: {event.id}")
```

- [ ] Test data created
- [ ] Event ID noted: ___________

---

## üé® Frontend Setup

### Step 4: Verify Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm list react-router-dom
```
- [ ] react-router-dom is installed
- [ ] If not installed: `npm install react-router-dom`

### Step 5: Add Route to Router
Location: `frontend/src/App.jsx` (or your main router file)

```javascript
import EventAnalyticsDashboard from './pages/EventAnalyticsDashboard';

// Add this route to your <Routes> component
<Route path="/events/:eventId/analytics" element={<EventAnalyticsDashboard />} />
```

- [ ] Route added to router configuration
- [ ] Import statement added

### Step 6: Add Navigation Link
Location: Event Detail page (e.g., `EventDetail.jsx`)

```javascript
import { Link, useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function EventDetail() {
  const { eventId } = useParams();
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your existing event details */}
      
      {/* Add this button */}
      <Link to={`/events/${eventId}/analytics`}>
        <button className="bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-semibold py-2 px-4 rounded">
          üìä View Analytics Dashboard
        </button>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}
```

- [ ] Link added to Event Detail page
- [ ] Button styled to match your app theme

### Step 7: Update API Configuration (if needed)
Location: `frontend/src/api/config.js`

Verify API_BASE_URL points to your backend:
```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL || 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/api';
```

- [ ] API_BASE_URL is correct
- [ ] CORS is configured on backend

---

## üß™ Testing

### Step 8: Manual Testing
- [ ] Start backend: `./scripts/start-backend.cmd`
- [ ] Start frontend: `./scripts/start-frontend.cmd`
- [ ] Navigate to an event detail page
- [ ] Click "View Analytics" button
- [ ] Verify dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] Verify all metrics display correctly:
  - [ ] Tickets Issued shows correct number
  - [ ] Checked In shows correct number
  - [ ] Pending Check-in calculates correctly
  - [ ] Venue Capacity displays
  - [ ] Progress bars render
  - [ ] Percentages calculate correctly

### Step 9: Edge Cases Testing
- [ ] Test with event that has 0 tickets
- [ ] Test with event at full capacity
- [ ] Test with event where all tickets are checked in
- [ ] Test with event where no tickets are checked in
- [ ] Test refresh button functionality

### Step 10: Responsive Testing
- [ ] Test on mobile view (< 768px)
- [ ] Test on tablet view (768px - 1024px)
- [ ] Test on desktop view (> 1024px)
- [ ] Verify layout adjusts appropriately

---

## üé® Customization (Optional)

### Step 11: Theme Matching
- [ ] Update colors to match your app theme
- [ ] Adjust card shadows/borders
- [ ] Customize button styles
- [ ] Update typography

### Step 12: Additional Features
- [ ] Add print functionality
- [ ] Add export to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Add charts using Chart.js or Recharts
- [ ] Add real-time updates with WebSockets
- [ ] Add filtering/date range selection

---

## üîí Security & Permissions

### Step 13: Access Control
- [ ] Verify only event organizers can view analytics
- [ ] Add authentication check in component
- [ ] Add permission check in backend view
- [ ] Test with different user roles

Example frontend auth check:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  // Check if user is organizer
  if (currentUser.id !== event.organizer_id) {
    navigate('/unauthorized');
  }
}, [event, currentUser]);
```

---

## üì± Mobile Optimization

### Step 14: Mobile UX
- [ ] Test touch interactions
- [ ] Verify text is readable on small screens
- [ ] Check button sizes are touch-friendly (min 44px)
- [ ] Test landscape orientation

---

## üöÄ Deployment

### Step 15: Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Run backend migrations
- [ ] Build frontend: `npm run build`
- [ ] Test production build locally
- [ ] Update environment variables

### Step 16: Deploy
- [ ] Deploy backend
- [ ] Deploy frontend
- [ ] Test in production environment
- [ ] Verify API endpoints accessible

---

## üìä Monitoring

### Step 17: Post-Deployment
- [ ] Monitor API response times
- [ ] Check error logs
- [ ] Gather user feedback
- [ ] Track analytics usage metrics

---

## üìö Documentation

### Step 18: Team Onboarding
- [ ] Share this checklist with team
- [ ] Review FEATURE_EVENT_ANALYTICS.md
- [ ] Review ANALYTICS_QUICKSTART.md
- [ ] Review ANALYTICS_VISUAL_MOCKUP.md
